📬 Inbox Spend Tracker — Project Overview

🔍 What it does:
The Inbox Spend Tracker is a smart automation tool that extracts and organizes your expenses from email receipts. Instead of manually entering transactions into a spreadsheet or app, users can forward their transaction emails, and the system will automatically:

Read the email contents
Extract transaction details like amount, date, vendor, and category
Store the information in a structured format
Present a summary of spending habits
